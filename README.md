<h3>Doodlekit Use Case</h3>
Use a cloud based machine learning tool such as IBM Watson or Wolfram Language to analyze sentiment across public information such as Twitter or a public database.  Create an application that uses this in a novel and useful way.
 
 
<h3>Application Overview</h3>

Based on the data fetched from Meetup Sentiment Analysis is done using IBM Bluemix Alchemy API for the comments done for events.

<b>Softwares/Tools Used:</b> Webstorm, Node JS, Javascript, JQuery, appbase.io
